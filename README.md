# EpicGames
This is the code I have written to process the Weekly Client File for the Epic Games Xbox team at Yahoo.
As the files are data intensive, and needs some differentiation as well, the code is broken out by the product, Fortnite and RL(RocketLeague)
I have 2 scripts for each of them, originally written in R, and then moved to Python.
